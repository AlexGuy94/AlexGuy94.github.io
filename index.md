## Welcome to My Projects Page!

I hope with the start of this page to populate with and feature various projects
that showcase and highlight my skills and experience.

A little about me, I'm a junior year computer science major, I cook part time at a fine dining establishment,
and I am most interested in data science and machine learning.

My skillset includes...
- Java
- C
- Python
- R
- Matlab
